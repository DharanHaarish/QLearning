# QLearning
Simple Q learning with the open-AI gym(Taxi environment)
Reinforcement Learning is an subdomain in the field of AI where an agent learns by interacting with an environment(most of the times) and gets reward for good actions and gets 
punished for bad actions and Q learning make use of the numpy array to assign value function(value function tells abput the value of that state) for all states although this method
cannot be used for a bigger environment open-AI gym provides us with smaller environments to test these algorithms.
